# Hi, I am Alan, A twenty-four year old software engineer from Kerala based in Manchester, UK.

I graduated with my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from the Army Institute of Technology, Pune, in July 2021. After working a year as a software developer at HSBC, I pursued my Master of Science in Advanced Computer Science at the University of Manchester, graduating with Distinction in Dec 2023. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the University of Manchester researching on the application of unikernels in serverless computing.

My primary area of interest and research is cloud computing. I have experience working with various cloud platforms, including Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Platform handling SPAs, data pipelines, serverless architecture and distributed computing. I'm familiar with container runtimes and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes. Additionally, I have experience with multiple CI/CD tools and am well-versed in observability tools, primarily Prometheus and Grafana.

In addition to my technical skills, I'm passionate about contributing to open-source projects and networking with like-minded individuals. Outside of work, I enjoy photography and editing. I'm always eager to discuss technology, design, or football and would love to connect with others in the field.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about my experience or discussing potential opportunities. I look forward to hearing from you!
